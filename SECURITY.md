# Security policy

This is a personal portfolio repository, maintained on a best-effort basis with no support commitment.
See the [Known limitations](README.md#known-limitations) and
[ADR 0006](docs/adr/0006-trust-proxy-behind-alb.md) for the documented trade-offs before you report them as
issues.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Do not open a public issue. Use GitHub's private reporting: **Security** tab, then **Report a
vulnerability**. Include the affected file, steps to reproduce and the impact.

Reports are read when time allows; there is no response-time guarantee. Fixes land on `main`, and only the
latest commit on `main` is supported.

## Scope

In scope: the code in this repository. Out of scope: vulnerabilities in the AWS provider, Terraform or other
third-party tools (report them upstream), the application deployed by this repository
([nest-next-starter](https://github.com/sotream/nest-next-starter)), and the documented trade-offs.
